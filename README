carbonapi: replacement graphite API server
------------------------------------------

CarbonAPI supports a limited subset of graphite functions, but in our testing
has shown to be 5x-10x faster than requesting data from graphite-web.

To use this, you must have a carbonzipper install (
https://github.com/dgryski/carbonzipper ), which in turn requires that your
carbon stores are running carbonserver ( https://github.com/grobian/carbonserver )

The only required parameter is the address of the zipper to connect to.

$ ./carbonapi -z=http://zipper:8080

Request metrics will be dumped to graphite if the -graphite flag is provided,
or if the GRAPHITEHOST/GRAPHITEPORT environment variables are found.

Request data will be stored in memory (default) or in memcache.
